Info: Low junction temperature is 0 degrees C
Info: High junction temperature is 85 degrees C
Info: Fitter is performing an Auto Fit compilation, which may decrease Fitter effort to reduce compilation time
Info: Device migration not selected. If you intend to use device migration later, you may need to change the pin assignments as they may be incompatible with other devices
